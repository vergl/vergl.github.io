### Hi there! 
![Yep, it's me](/images/me_for_blog.png){:height="40%" width="40%"}

Glad to see you on my blog!
My name is Stan and I'm a software engineer in a cybersecurity company.
I'm passionate about distributed computing, microservice architecture and practical cybersecurity.

Here in this blog, I'd like to share some thoughts about Java, Spring Framework ecosystem and computer science in general.

I hope you can find something interesting and useful here. Feel free to contact me via e-mail or comments under the post if you have any questions :)
